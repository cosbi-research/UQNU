# 📁 Folder Overview

This folder contains the scripts to run the proposed method in the purely data-driven case -the models are pure Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs)- for the three dynamical systems: **damped oscillator**, **Lorenz system**, and **Lotka-Volterra**, trained on different triples of trajectories. The structure includes configuration files, result analyses, launcher scripts, and utility modules.

## 📂 Folder Structure

### 📊 Results Folders

- **`analysis_results_damped/`**
- **`analysis_results_lorenz/`**
- **`analysis_results_lv/`**  
  These folders contain the analysis of the results of the method proposed for each of the respective systems.

- **`results_maximized_traj_1/`**  
  This folder contains the results as `.jld` files of the method proposed for the first triple of trajectories. For each dynamical system, the method was run starting from 10 different initializations, resulting in 10 corresponding result folders.
- **`results_maximized_traj_2/`**  
  This folder contains the results as `.jld` files of the method proposed for the second triple of trajectories. For each dynamical system, the method was run starting from 10 different initializations, resulting in 10 corresponding result folders.
- **`results_maximized_traj_3/`**  
  This folder contains the results as `.jld` files of the method proposed for the third triple of trajectories. For each dynamical system, the method was run starting from 10 different initializations, resulting in 10 corresponding result folders.

- **`training_NODE_results/`**  
  This folder contains the results of standard ensembling on the three different dynamical systems. One random model from each standard ensemble is used as the starting point for our method.

## ⚙️ Configuration and Utility Scripts

- `configurations_damped.jl`  
- `configurations_lorenz.jl`  
- `configurations_lv.jl`  
  Julia scripts containing parameter settings or simulation options for each system.

- `ConfidenceEllipse.jl`  
  Julia module containing functions to work with confidence ellipses of a multivariate normal distribution.
